# wiremod-svn-archive

This repo is a saved copy of the wiremod google code svn archive.
Some changes were made, mainly restoring the last working version
published from before the devs attempted a repo blanking.
The revision history allowed me to restore the code.
Thanks to a method of cloning svn repos and all of
their commits, I was able to save the original wiremod
svn repo to another repo. And now I have copied it to github.

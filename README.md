# wiremod-svn-archive

This repo is a saved copy of the wiremod google code svn archive.
Some changes were made, mainly restoring the last working version
published from before the devs attempted a repo blanking.
The revision history allowed me to restore the code.
Thanks to a method of cloning svn repos and all of
their commits, I was able to save the original wiremod
svn repo to another repo. And now I have copied it to github.

NOTE: If you are able to get this to work, you likely are using
a PIRATED copy of Garry's Mod, as this was designed for
Garry's Mod TWELVE and lower. There is already a git repo
for the latest wiremod for the latest Garry's Mod, if
you are looking to use the current wiremod, look up THAT
repo. This one is purely legacy code

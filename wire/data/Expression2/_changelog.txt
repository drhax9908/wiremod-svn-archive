===============================================================================
The changelog only lists additions and major fixes, minor fixes are not listed.

2009-03-16
fixed Wirelinks, they always duplicate properly now!, previously broken dupes
  should also automatically become functional without any rewiring.

2009-03-15
added [exit()] for stopping execution of the expression

2009-03-14
added [@trigger]-directive, change the way the executions are triggered, all is
  the old behaviour, none means that it never triggers by inputs, or you can
  specify a list of inputs that will trigger execution.
  examples: @trigger all, @trigger none, @trigger Button, @trigger Button1 Button 2

added [runOnTick(N)] and [tickClk()], works like a timer, but is executed each
  tick (server frame), which means that it is perfect for use with physics-based
  contraptions, both to lessen lag and to prevent applyForce from being applied
  mulitple times in a single frame.

2009-03-13
added [reset()], resets the expression, just as if you would reset it externally.

2009-03-12
added [E:isAdmin()=N] and [E:isSuperAdmin()=N], to determine if a player is admin.



... and lots more has improved in the days, weeks, and months before that, check out
    the wiki for more information on the functions available.

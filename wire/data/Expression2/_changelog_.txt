# ===============================================================================
# The changelog only lists additions and major fixes, minor fixes are not listed.
# 
#

# 
# 2009-04-03
# ADDED editor improvements by TomyLobo, it is now possible to indent and outdent

#
# 2009-03-27

#   Visit http://www.wiremod.com/forum/wiremod-addons/8240-jimlads-wire-addons.html
#   for more information and feedback.
#
# 2009-03-24
# ADDED npc-extension by Bobsymalone, it is now possible to "mind control" your
#   NPCs and have the act the way you want!
#
# 2009-03-16
# ADDED autosaving to the editor, it now automatically saves a copy of your script
#   every minute when something has changed, or when you close the editor or
#   load another expression.
# FIXED Wirelinks, they always duplicate properly now!, previously broken dupes
#   should also automatically become functional without any rewiring.
# 
# 2009-03-15
# ADDED [exit()] for stopping execution of the expression
# 
# 2009-03-14
# ADDED [@trigger]-directive, change the way the executions are triggered, all is
#   the old behaviour, none means that it never triggers by inputs, or you can
#   specify a list of inputs that will trigger execution.
#   examples: @trigger all, @trigger none, @trigger Button, @trigger Button1 Button 2
# 
# ADDED [runOnTick(N)] and [tickClk()], works like a timer, but is executed each
#   tick (server frame), which means that it is perfect for use with physics-based
#   contraptions, both to lessen lag and to prevent applyForce from being applied
#   mulitple times in a single frame.
# 
# 2009-03-13
# ADDED [reset()], resets the expression, just as if you would reset it externally.
# 
# 2009-03-12
# ADDED [E:isAdmin()=N] and [E:isSuperAdmin()=N], to determine if a player is admin.
# 
# 
# ... and lots more has improved in the days, weeks, and months before that, check out
#     the wiki for more information on the functions available.
